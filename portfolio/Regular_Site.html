            Does rapid increase of AI technology lead to a need for basic income as many workers fall behind?
            Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require
            human intelligence. They are theoretically supposed to perform actions such as driving cars, manufacturing, teaching,
            and other actions. The term artificial intelligence was first coined by John McCarthy in 1956 when he held the first
            academic conference on the subject. John McCarthy is known as the “father” of AI. His objective in his research was
            to explore if machines could reason like humans.  He created the Lisp computer Language, which was the first standard
            AI programming Language. He also conceived the idea of computer time-sharing or networking, which paved the way for the
            development of the internet.
