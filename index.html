        <h1>Our home needs our help</h1>
        <p>
            The Earth needs our help. If we don’t make massive changes to our
            behavior over the next twelve years, the damage we’ve done to this planet will be irreversible.
            Oceans will be destroyed, super storms will become even more super, cities will flood, the air will suck,
            and we’ll run out of food and energy. And not in a couple of hundred years either, scientists say it's right
            around the corner. But the power to prevent this is in our hands! We can save the Earth!!!

        <h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
        <p>
            There is a current global need for clean and renewable energy sources. Fossil fuels are non-renewable and
            require finite resources, which are dwindling because of high cost and environmentally damaging retrieval
            techniques. So, the need for cheap and obtainable resources is greatly needed. An efficient and more
            feasible alternative option is solar energy.
            Solar energy is a more practical type of energy due to its plentiful availability; it is derived directly
            from the sun. In 2010, renewable energy only provided 8 percent of the total energy consumption in the
            United States.
            Many people probably wonder: if renewable energy is so beneficial, why don’t we consume more of it? The
            answer to the question is that many of the renewable energy sources are more expensive and more difficult to
            retrieve. Thus, because of these limitations, the consumption of fossil fuels has grown to an exorbitant
            rate.
            Although there has been an increased effort to incorporate solar power, these efforts have not alternated
            its use by a great amount; less than 1 percent of the electricity in the United States is supplied by solar
            power. In the United States, California utilizes the most solar power.
        </p>
        <h4>Right now, everything in our lives could be powered by clean, renewable energy.</h4>
        <p>From our homes and smartphones to the electricity running our local grocery stores, clean energy is not only
            possible – it’s already happening. The Solutions Project accelerates the transition to 100% clean energy by
            championing a movement that is more inclusive, more collaborative, and more celebratory. Through
            storytelling, grantmaking, and capacity building, we honor clean energy leaders, invest in promising
            solutions, and build relationships between unlikely allies.
            Together, we can make renewable energy a reality for everyone – 100% for 100%
